		<ul>
			<li>
				You must have at least 3 scales for an indicator.
			</li>
			<li>
				You must have no more than 9 scales for an indicator.
			</li>
			<li>
				Scales must be entered in order from smallest to biggest.
			</li>
			<li>
				If the scale includes a large number, do not include a comma in the number (e.g., 250,000  should be entered as 250000)
			</li>
			<li>
				You do not need to include a scale item for 'No Data'.  That is automatically added for you.
