        help_3: "If the scale includes a large number, do not include a comma in the number (e.g., 250,000  should be entered as 250000)"

        help_4_2: "Sequential ranges (e.g., 100-200, 200-300, etc) must start with the same number that the previous range ended with. If you use the following scale of 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, etc,  a value of 200.2 will not match with the 101-200 scale or the 201-300 scale, and, therefore, will not appear in the application."
